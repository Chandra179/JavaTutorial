Spring Bootâ€”Production Boost
- dependencies: flyway, jdbc, postgres, spring-actuator, spring-test-container
- how to make sure the test is self-contained?
  -> use: spring-test-container dependencies
  -> use: @TestPropertySource
  -> h2 would still work but to match production DB with test DB we need to use "spring test"
- how to observe the running application?
  -> use: spring-boot-actuator
  -> cloud native needs to be observable their internal state when run in production
- configuration strategies
  -> configuration properties (property files): 
     - default values
     - development env variables
  -> configuration service (spring cloud config): 
     - connection pools
     - timeouts and retries
     - feature flags
     - external services (url & passwords)
  -> kubernetes platform (ConfigMaps & secrets)
     - spring active profiles
     - internal services (url & passwords)
- configuring resources for JVM containers (CPU & Memory)
  -> CPU is: compressible resource, when LIMIT hit then process is THROTTLED
  -> Memory is: non-compressible resource, when LIMIT hit then OUT OF MEMORY killed error
